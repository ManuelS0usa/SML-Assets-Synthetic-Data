# Asset Predictive Maintenance use-case for a Synthetic Railway Company
### Supervised Machine Learning Project | Manuel Sousa | 27.04.2022

### Context
In our case-study, a Railway company wanted to  understand if it was possible to predict railway switch failures, leveraging IoT and other maintenance and faults 
data. The ability to forecast maintenance failures would: reduce train disruptions, improve operation teams ability to react, increase customer satisfaction and save the business from inefficient costs, and unexpected responses.

### Data Set Information:
- Asset dataset - This is data that describes the asset
- Asset repairs - This details the repairs of assets
- Asset replacements - This is a list of times when assets have been replaced (failed)
- Planned maintenance - This describes if the reapir or replacement 
- Additional asset attributes - This gives additional infomation about assets
